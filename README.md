# Roblox Custom Keyboard Sounds Script  

This is a simple script for Roblox that lets you add custom keyboard sounds. When you press a key, it plays a sound based on the selected key.  

The reason I created this is that my mechanical keyboard broke a long time ago, and I genuinely missed the sound it madeâ€”especially while playing games like *Da Hood* or FPS games, where the sound of a mechanical keyboard adds a satisfying touch to the experience.  

### How to Set It Up  

1. Press **Windows Key + R** and type `%localappdata%`.  
2. Navigate to the following folder path:  
   **Roblox -> Versions -> [Currently active version] -> content**  
   (Note: Usually, only one version folder contains files.)  
3. Inside the **content** folder, create a new folder named **"KeyboardSounds"**.  

### Recommended Sound Files  

For the best experience, I recommend downloading sound files from [Mechvibes](https://mechvibes.com/sound-packs/) and pasting them into the **KeyboardSounds** folder. Use files named `key1`, `key2`, `key3`, `key4`, etc., as the script references these names.  

Enjoy the satisfying sound of your custom mechanical keyboard setup!
